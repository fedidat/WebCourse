Level 9 - GraphQL
-----------------

Welcome to what is essentially a bonus level about the great GraphQL specification, which is a very popular way to fetch data from a server without the usual constraint of the old REST approach.

1. Start with Oleg Ilyenko's short and concise "Introduction to GraphQL" [presentation](http://slidedeck.io/OlegIlyenko/presentation-graphql-introduction).
2. Look at https://www.howtographql.com/ for a good introduction and thorough tutorials.
3. Browse through some example of [Apollo Launchpad](https://launchpad.graphql.com/new): see the README on [their Github repo](https://github.com/apollographql/launchpad) for many examples of uses of GraphQL with Javascript.

That's it! No exercise is left to the reader. You might end up using GraphQL anyway if you haven't already.

And this is the end of this course! At this point, students would belong to one of two groups:
* The ones that have to quickly finish whatever exercises they need to get credit for the course.
* The ones that play Counter-Strike 1.6 while waiting for 5:00PM. ;)
