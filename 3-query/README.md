Level 3 - JQuery
----------------

This is the most time-consuming level. You will have to re-implement the JQuery framework using Vanilla Javascript. 

JQuery is an ubiquitous JS utils library bringing many features not in Vanilla JS (mostly about easy DOM manipulation). 

The exercise, although lengthy, is surprisingly simple and gives a thorough understanding of Javascript if done correctly.
