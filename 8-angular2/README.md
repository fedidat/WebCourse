Level 9 - angular.io
--------------------

You have reached the ultimate purpose of this course: learning angular.io
(also called Angular 2+). This is (at the moment of writing...) a very popular framework using components and enabling server-side rendering, based on node.js and typescript. 

It is directly competing with React, a very different approach using libraries and JSX to tackle the same component-based reusability approach.

1. Take a look at [the official site](https://angular.io/) and try to look at the actual Tour of Heroes tutorial (unlike the one in level 5, based on plain node.js).
2. Solve the final exercise, TeamChat. Look at the docx.
