This is a 3.5 week web course I did at work. I document it here for me, though it may be of use to others.

Don't even think about cheating with this!

Anyway, the subfolders should be followed in order of numbering. 
Each of them should take about about 1.5 day. "3-query" may take a little longer.
Sadly, most of the exercise files are in Hebrew.
